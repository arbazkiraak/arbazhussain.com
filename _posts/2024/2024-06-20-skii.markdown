description: "Guide to Shymbulak Ski Resort in Kazakhstan and Skii learning experience"
---

This winter, I finally decided to fulfill a long-held dream of learning to ski. I packed my bags and headed to [Shymbulak Ski Resort in Kazakhstan](https://shymbulak.com/), a place renowned for its stunning slopes and breathtaking views. As I stood at the top of the mountain, feeling the crisp air against my face, I couldn't help but think of Jean-Claude Killy. 

In 1965, a young Killy stood on a similar snow-covered peak in the French Alps, facing the challenge ahead with determination. His journey from that moment led him to become one of the greatest skiers of all time, winning three gold medals at the 1968 Winter Olympics. Killy’s story, like many others, is a testament to the enduring spirit of skiing—a sport that challenges the body, mind, and soul.

## Why Shymbulak?

#### A Unique Destination
Kazakhstan might not be the first place that comes to mind for a winter sports holiday, but Shymbulak Ski Resort in Almaty offers a unique and unforgettable skiing experience. The resort is the biggest and most modern in Central Asia, boasting a diverse set of slopes suitable for skiers and snowboarders of all levels.

One of the appealing aspects of Shymbulak is its affordability compared to more famous ski resorts in Europe or North America. Additionally, it's easily accessible from Almaty, with public transport options making the journey straightforward and convenient.

The winter sports season in Almaty usually starts from late November or early December and continues until late March, depending on the season and the snowfall. The high altitude ensures the slopes retain their snow well throughout the season.

From Almaty, take bus 12 from Dostyk Avenue (Dostyk Plaza or Hotel Kazakhstan stops). This bus takes you to Medeu, the highest ice skating rink in the world, in about 30 minutes. Get off one stop before the bus terminal at Medeu to find the cable car station across the street.

### Standing Up and Finding Your Balance

Standing up on skis can be daunting, especially on a slope. But like Killy, every great skier starts somewhere.

[![Standing Up on Skis](https://img.youtube.com/vi/UWc7k5bUmRs/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UWc7k5bUmRs)

1. **Stand Up**: Rotate your body perpendicular to the slope to find stability. Use your sticks for support.
2. **Walk in a Semicircle**: Position yourself correctly by walking in a semicircle if needed.

Your stance is crucial in skiing. Lean forward, adopting a slight squat position with your ankles flexed. Your body should form a shape like a forward slash (\) or an open angle (<).

### Mastering Basic Techniques

The foundation of skiing lies in mastering basic techniques. These fundamentals will serve as your bedrock as you progress to more advanced maneuvers.[^4][Skiing Basics]

1. **Snowplow**: One of the first techniques you’ll learn is the snowplow. By positioning your skis in a wide V shape (similar to jumping jack openings), you control your speed and maintain balance. This technique is vital for beginners to build confidence on the slopes.

2. **Jumping**: Practice small jumps to get comfortable with the sensation of leaving the ground and landing back on your skis. This will help you navigate bumps and uneven terrain.

### Turning and Carving

Turning and carving are essential skills that allow you to navigate the slopes with grace and precision.

1. **Turning**: 
    - **Weight Distribution**: Turn by putting more weight on one ski and slightly turning your feet. The ski should be slightly edgy, lifting on one side to facilitate the turn.
2. **Carving**: 
    - **Parallel Turns**: Practice parallel turns to carve through the snow with more control. 
    - **J-Turn Practice**: Engage in J-turn practices to perfect your carving technique.

### Personal Reflections: A Day on the Slopes

During my time at Shymbulak, I had the pleasure of meeting a group of seasoned skiers who graciously took me under their wing. Watching them effortlessly glide down the mountain, I realized that skiing was as much about technique as it was about embracing the moment. Each fall was a lesson, each turn a victory. The camaraderie and shared passion for the sport were palpable, making every run down the slope a shared celebration of triumph and perseverance.

## Closing Words

Skiing at Shymbulak was more than just a winter getaway; it was a journey of self-discovery and a test of resilience. As I glided (and sometimes stumbled) down the slopes, I realized that skiing is a lot like life. There are highs and lows, triumphs and setbacks, but what really matters is the determination to keep going. The breathtaking views of the Tien Shan Mountains and the exhilarating rush of speeding down the slopes reminded me that every challenge we face is an opportunity to grow and to find joy in the journey.

Whether you're an experienced skier or a beginner like me, Shymbulak offers an adventure that's both thrilling and enriching. So, pack your bags, embrace the adventure, and remember: it's not about how many times you fall, but how many times you get back up. Happy skiing!
